    Hey All, my name is Eric and I am a recent graduate of the Back End Engineeering program
    at The Iron Yard in Durham, NC.  I live in Durham with my wife and we are expecting our first
    child any day now.  My favorite past times include attending sporting events,
    cooking, and being out in nature.  After working in the Finance industry for the last decade
    I took a chance on myself and decided to follow my passion into technology and learn
    to code.
